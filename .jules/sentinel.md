## 2024-05-23 - Critical Auth Bypass in User Routes
**Vulnerability:** The `list_users` and `get_user` endpoints in `user_routes.py` were missing authentication checks.
**Learning:** Even with a clean architecture, missing decorators on the presentation layer can expose sensitive data.
**Prevention:** Always verify that route handlers dealing with sensitive data (PII) have `@require_auth` applied.
